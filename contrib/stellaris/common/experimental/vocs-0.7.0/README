A collection of source code modules to add wordlists, vocabularies, vocabulary
prefixes and classes (for context switching objects) to Mecrisp-Stellaris Forth.

Vocabulary prefixes (VOCs) and implicit context switching may be new concepts
for most Forth users.

VOCs can be used to create library name spaces and in combination with implicit
context switching data types and register identifiers can be created.

Finally adding inheritance to VOCs makes it easy to use VOCs to define classes
of context switching objects.

For further informations please read the intros of the module files. 

The code modules were originally written and are maintained to be used with the
e4thcom terminal program (vocs-0.7.x-FR), so that they can be loaded on demand
as required.

For those of you that prefer to use a vanilla terminal, the basic code modules
have been concatenated into one file (vocs.txt in vocs-0.7.x-FRV). 

The VOC-HOWTO files enclosed in vocs-0.7.0-FR can only be executed with the
e4thcom terminal but vanilla terminal users can display the related .log files
with the cat command in an ANSI terminal emulator.

Some code examples are added in the examples folder. To use this with a vanilla 
terminal comment out the #require and the \index tags and load the required 
files by hand.

Please notice that this is not a final release but code under development.
